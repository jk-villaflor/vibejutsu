Simon Says Game - Python Implementation

DESIGN NOTES AND REASONING:

1. GAME MECHANICS:
   - Simon Says is a memory game where players must repeat an increasingly longer sequence
   - The game generates random sequences and checks if the player can repeat them correctly
   - Each round adds one more step to the sequence, making it progressively harder
   - This tests working memory capacity and pattern recognition

2. TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
   - Using random.randint() for sequence generation ensures unpredictability
   - List data structure for storing sequences allows easy appending and comparison
   - Input validation prevents crashes from invalid user input
   - Clear visual feedback with print statements and formatting
   - Score tracking motivates continued play

3. USER EXPERIENCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Clear instructions at the start
   - Visual separation between game phases (display vs input)
   - Immediate feedback on correct/incorrect responses
   - Final score display provides closure and achievement
   - Simple input method (number keys) reduces cognitive load

4. EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
   - Demonstrates list operations (append, comparison)
   - Shows input validation and error handling
   - Illustrates game loop patterns
   - Teaches basic scoring systems
   - Shows how to create engaging user interfaces with text

5. ACCESSIBILITY:
   - Text-based interface works on any system
   - No external dependencies required
   - Clear, readable output formatting
   - Simple input method accessible to all users
