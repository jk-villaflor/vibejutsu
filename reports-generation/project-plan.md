# Project Plan

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Sales Activity Report Generator
- **Start Date:** June 16, 2025
- **Project Status:** Initial Planning

## Objectives
- Build an Express.js web application that generates a weekly sales activity report.
- Provide options to export the report in PDF and XLS formats.
- Use static data and a report layout matching the provided screenshot.
- Lay the groundwork for future integration with dynamic data sources.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Express.js backend setup
- Static data modeling (matching screenshot fields)
- HTML/CSS template to match the report layout
- PDF generation (e.g., using Puppeteer or pdfkit)
- XLS generation (e.g., using exceljs)
- API endpoints for triggering report generation and download

### Out of Scope
- User authentication
- Dynamic data integration
- Frontend UI beyond basic download triggers
- Deployment to production

## Resources Required
- 1 Node.js/Express developer
- 1 QA/tester (optional)
- Development environment (Node.js, npm)
- Libraries: express, pdfkit/puppeteer, exceljs

## Deliverables
1. Express.js project with endpoints for report generation
2. Static data model matching the screenshot
3. PDF and XLS report generation functionality
4. Documentation (setup, usage, future improvements)

## Risks and Mitigation
- **PDF/XLS formatting complexity:** Start with static layout and iterate; use proven libraries.
- **Environment issues:** Use containerization or document setup steps clearly.

## Success Criteria
- Application generates a PDF or XLS file using static data matching the screenshot layout.
